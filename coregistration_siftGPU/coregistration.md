## Using SIFTGPU for Co-registration of remote sensing images

I developed a program to co-registrator remote sensing images based on SIFTGPU in 2013. 
The software environment has changed a lot. 
Here, we built a docker container, with Ubuntu 14.04 in it, then install SIFTGPU and the program 
I developed. 



### Install SIFTGPU
[SIFTGPU](https://github.com/pitzer/SiftGPU) is GPU implement of the [SIFT](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:VISI.0000029664.99615.94) 
algorithm.
We will build a docker container to install it. 

There is a GitHub repo about installing SiftGPU on Ubuntu 16.04: [link](https://github.com/wangq95/SiftGPU_Linux)
